Hi, I'm Eliecer :wave:

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a programmer living in Malaga, Spain, and I'm currently working at Freepik Company as part of the platform's search engine development team.

I have experience in languages like Java, PHP and Python, as well as technologies like gRPC, PHP Slim and DDD (Domain-Driven Design). Currently, my team is working on using Artificial Intelligence to find the most relevant images for our users.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to connecting with other professionals and continuing to grow as a developer. Join me on this exciting web development journey!
