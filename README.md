# About
Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Eliecer and I'm a developer living in Malaga, Spain. I'm currently working at Freepik Company as part of the platform's search engine development team.

I have experience in languages like Java, PHP and Python, as well as technologies like PHP Slim, DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and gRPC. Currently, my team is working on using Artificial Intelligence to find the most relevant images for our users.
